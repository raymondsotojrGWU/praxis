The files in this repo are a combination of jupyter notebooks and python scripts for my research in Federated Machine Learning.
I have also included the initial MLP global model.
The dataset used for this research can be found on the University of New South Wales' site https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset
